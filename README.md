# fun-with-c
This repository includes various C/C++ project

1. Swapping first and last nibble -> C code for 8, 12, 16 bit numbers
2. Swapping and sorting of an odd length array -> swap the numbers first (swap first half and second half from middle) and then sort them as shown:
   Input array -> 2 1 3 5 4,
   After swapping -> 5 4 3 2 1, 
   After sorting -> 4 5 3 1 2 
3. Calculate the n-moving average of a given array.
   For example -> to calculate 5 - moving average ->
   Intial array 1 2 3 4 5 -> avg = 3
   Add new number 6 to the end of an array as 1 2 3 4 5 6 but for 5-moving avg calculation, only 2 3 4 5 6 will be consider and avg = 4
4. Arrays of structure -> It shows the basic example on how to use array of structure in C
